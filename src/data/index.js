        desc: "The Blood GA Analyser for Provigate marks an important step forward in the management of diabetic patients. GA (Glycoalbumin) is an alternative marker of glucose monitoring and may be more useful than HbA1c (Glycated Hemoglobin) in evaluating short-term glycemic changes. This device should be able to simplify the life of diabetic subjects and its design was achieved keeping in mind, during the whole process, three fundamental words: Honest, User-Friendly and Gentle. Except for the display and the back cover, the body doesn't have any flat surface, obtaining an overall soft feeling. Conceived for clinics and hospitals, thanks to the curved surfaces, the device looks even more compact than it is and its pure and honest appearance blends in every environment. The product is user-friendly for doctors and at the same time has a kind of familiar appearance which also puts patients at ease. The angled touch screen panel was carefully considered to be easily used both when sitting or standing. Its high gloss finishing creates a pleasant contrast with the matte body panels. In the front, a small door hides the slot for the samples testing cartridge, while in the back ports for power cable, usb, etc. found place. The ports are moved inward to let the device be placed as close as possible to a wall.",

To avoid gaps between them and the headboard, the cushions are flat on the back side, but curved on the front to gently embrace the body. The bed's proportions are the result of an accurate research to find balance between frame, mattress and cushion and communicate an inviting atmosphere, The combination of wood, metal, fabric and leather enriches its luxurious presence and options such as bedside tables and footboard extend the functionality. The tapered edges of the frame give a sense of lightness to the bed even though its generous dimensions. Thanks to the possibility to choose between different materials and sizes, the bed is suitable for any bedroom.",

        desc: "The project was born with the aim of designing a plate that could communicate better the pairing of different soy sauces with food and to promote the producers behind them, delivering a tasting experience. The main feature was to split the plate in three compartments so that different soy sauces could have been enjoyed in a single plate without getting mixed. The plate's clean presence is the result of a long development, where every detail has been perfected with the purpose of the function and optimisation of the production process. It is produced in the Hasami area, one of the most important in Japan for the production of ceramics. The size was carefully considered in order to contain the right amount of soy sauce but without interfering on the table with other tableware. The curvature of the containers allows one to enjoy the right amount of soy sauce, as a barely visible dent in the section minimises the excess of sauce. The bridge shape has the purpose to allow placing an explanation sheet underneath it, to suggest the best pairing with the food served, as well as information about the typology of sauces and producers. Stackability was another feature to keep in mind and every detail, from the tapered edges of the long sides to the slight curvature on the short ones, delivers a secure and tidy feeling when more plates are stored. The tapered edges also facilitate holding and moving the plate around, while working as structural elements. The plate, with its design resulting from an accurate development and without any unnecessary decoration, aims to become a standard in its category.",

With a history that goes back to 1717 when Aizuya opened the first store, the tableware store in the Bunkyo area of Tokyo has been loved by the local people since 1911.The concept for the design of the new store was to retain the dignity of Aizuya's 300+ years old history and to reflect the cheerful atmosphere of the owner Koichiro Sugita in the space. The stores that have been in business until now are lined with display shelves in various finishes that give a sense of history and Kobayashi embraced the desire of the owner to continue using those display shelves that he had been using for many years.Aizuya selects works by various artists, in a range of different materials such as ceramic, glass and Japanese lacquer.To showcase in the best way such a variety of products, the interior design presents a neutral atmosphere. As the display shelves had different finishes, the store owner himself and the design team sanded them, in order to reveal the natural wood underneath and give a sense of unity. This allowed them to match also with the newly manufactured furniture and table used for the space, as they were made of oak. The result was a natural harmony of the tone for the entire space. The large table located in the center of the store is set up so that customers can experience how the vessel looks and feels at home. At the same time it symbolizes the store owner's feelings of giving joyful time to their lives through the vessels.",
